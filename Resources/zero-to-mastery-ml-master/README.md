# Zero to Mastery Machine Learning

Welcome! This repository contains all of the code, notebooks, images and other materials related to the [Zero to Mastery Machine Learning Course on Udemy](https://dbourke.link/mlcourse).

As the course is still being developed, it's still a work in progress (plenty more to come!).

If you'd like to see anything in particular, please send me an email: [daniel@mrdbourke.com](mailto:daniel@mrdbourke.com) or leave an issue.

## What this course focuses on

1. Create a framework for working through problems ([6 step machine learning modelling framework](https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/master/section-1-getting-ready-for-machine-learning/a-6-step-framework-for-approaching-machine-learning-projects.md))
2. Find tools to fit the framework
3. Targeted practice = use tools and framework steps to work on end-to-end machine learning modelling projects 

## How this course is structured 

* Section 1 - Getting your mind and computer ready for machine learning (concepts, computer setup)
* Section 2 - Tools for machine learning and data science (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)
* Section 3 - End-to-end structured data projects (classification and regression)
* Section 4 - Neural networks, deep learning and transfer learning with TensorFlow 2.0
* Section 5 - Communicating and sharing your work
